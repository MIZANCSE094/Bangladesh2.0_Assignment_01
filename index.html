            "Bangladesh 2.0" embodies the dream of transforming Bangladesh into a modern, innovative, and inclusive nation. Dr. Muhammad Yunus envisions a future where entrepreneurship drives social change, technology empowers the poor, and poverty is a thing of the past. He believes in a world of "Three Zeros"—zero poverty, zero unemployment, and zero net carbon emissions—where human creativity leads to sustainable development and shared prosperity for all.
        </p><br>
        
            <h1>Dr. Muhammad Yunus</h1><br>
            Chief Adviser of the People's Republic of Bangladesh
